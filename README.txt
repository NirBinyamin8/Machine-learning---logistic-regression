ðŸ“© Ham/Spam Classifier: Machine Learning Approach


Harness the power of Machine Learning to classify messages as either ham (legitimate) or spam, using a custom-built Logistic Regression model.

## ðŸ“– Overview

In the ever-growing world of digital communication, distinguishing between genuine and spam messages has become crucial. This project employs the renowned ham/spam dataset to demonstrate a meticulous machine learning-based approach to this classification problem.

## ðŸŒŸ Features

1. **Custom Logistic Regression Model**: A specially tailored LogisticRegression class that's adaptable to similar classification challenges.
2. **ROC Curve Analysis**: Utilize the ROC curve to fine-tune model performance, ensuring robustness and reliability.
3. **Optimal Threshold Determination**: Achieve a delicate balance between precision and recall to choose the best decision boundary for classifying messages.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Required libraries: [list them here, e.g., numpy, pandas, matplotlib, scikit-learn]


## ðŸŽˆ Insights
