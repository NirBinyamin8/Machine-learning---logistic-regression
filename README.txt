This project centers on analyzing the ham/spam dataset using machine learning techniques. A custom LogisticRegression class was developed to classify the data. To fine-tune the model's performance and select the best decision boundary, the ROC Curve was plotted, aiding in the determination of the optimal threshold for classification.
